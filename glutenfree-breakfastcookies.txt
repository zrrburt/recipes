Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free
Serves: 26 cookies

Ingredients
•	2 medium ripe bananas
•	2 flax eggs (2 Tbsp flaxseed + 5 Tbsp water set for 5 mins)
•	1/2 cup natural, salted peanut butter (crunchy or smooth)
•	2 Tbsp refined coconut oil, melted (or canola oil)
•	1 tsp pure vanilla extract
•	3 Tbsp agave nectar (or sub maple syrup, or honey if not vegan)
•	1 1/2 cup gluten free rolled oats
•	1/2 cup oat flour (ground from GF oats)
•	1/2 cup almond meal (ground from raw almonds)
•	1/2 tsp baking powder
•	1/2 tsp baking soda
•	pinch sea salt (add more or less depending on saltiness of your PB)
•	3 Tbsp raw walnuts, lightly crushed (or sub other nut)
•	1/2 cup semisweet or dark chocolate chips (non-dairy for vegan)

Instructions
1.	Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.	In a large bowl combine flax seed and water and let rest for 5 minutes to achieve “eggy” texture.
3.	Mash in the bananas until well combined, and then add peanut butter, baking powder, baking soda, melted coconut oil, agave nectar, salt, vanilla and stir.
4.	Add oats, almond meal and oat flour and mix well.
5.	Add chocolate chips and walnuts and stir until well combined. Refrigerate for 5 minutes to harden.
6.	Drop cookies by spoonfuls on a lightly greased baking sheet – they won’t expand much. Also make them as uniform in size as possible to ensure even baking.
7.	Bake for 15-17 minutes or until the cookies are slightly golden brown.
8.	Let rest on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. After completely cooled, store in an air-tight container to keep fresh for up to a few days.
